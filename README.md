# Random_Python

I haven't coded much since leaving university so decided to pick Python back up and make small random projects.
At first I'm just going to start off with simple things to get back into it!

1. Guess The Number
  Started off with a simple program for guessing the numbers between 0 and 20
  The program now allows the user to:
    - input the lower and upper value range
    - input how many guessses they want
    - input their guess
  I went over the top with the error handling but the program shouldn't break!
