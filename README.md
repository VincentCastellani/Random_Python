# Random_Python

I haven't coded much since leaving university so decided to pick Python back up and make small random projects. At first I'm just going to start off with simple things to get back into it!

Overview of code

1. Guess The Number
	- Console application
	- Started off with a simple program for guessing the numbers between 0 and 20.
	- The program now allows the user to:
		- input the lower and upper value range
		- input how many guessses they want
		- input their guess
	- I went over the top with the error handling but the program shouldn't break!

2. Rock Paper Scissors
	- Console application
	- The player is able to choose how many games
	- The computer chooses a random option
	- Player inputs their choice
	- Calculates who has won
	- Updates a score counter
	- Once all games are done a winner is announced

3. Hangman
	- Console application
	- Reads a file of random words and selects one
	- User inputs a letter or word
	- This letter/word is check against the random word
	- If correct then the user can choose the next letter or they have won if they guessed the correct word
	- If incorrect then they lose a live and the hangman is drawn
	- The user can choose if they want to play again
	- The user can play until all the words in the list have been used, it will then tell the user that they have used all the words and end
	
4. Password Generator
	- Console application
	- Generates a password that is between 8 - 20 characters long
	- The password will contain a random number of letters (upper and lower), numbers and special characters
	- After making it I decided to have a google, and found that you can do this in 2 lines! The more you know!
